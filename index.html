        <h1> Marcus Groth </h1>
        <p style='margin-bottom:0.5em;'> 
          I graduated from KTH Royal Institute of Technology with a masters degree in Interactive Media Technology. In my thesis I compared the attitudes of Ethiopian and Swedish youth to fake news on the internet. My professional experience includes working as a graphic designer and front-end developer.

            For the course <em>Advanced Project</em> I made this interactive meditative sketch made with p5.js. The purpose was to examine whether digital tools can support mindfulness. You can try it out yourself <a href="boxes/index.html">here</a>.

            <em>The boxes are resting and hard to spot, but if you move your mouse around you can wake them up!</em>

              For my bachelor thesis, I made a filter visualization tool for iOS and Android with MobMuPlat and Pure Data. <a href= 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ble_teYNGawTI1PYxzKz2w5ReYf6e5Or/view?usp=sharing'>Here</a> is a video showcase. I wanted to see if I could use instant visual and auditory feedback to make filters (a notoriously hard topic to get into) more accessible and interesting. My study concluded that the visualization tool did indeed make the participants find filters more interesting. The source code can be found <a href= 'https://github.com/MGroth/SignalFilterVisualization'>here</a>.
