        <p style='margin-bottom:0.5em;'> 
          I graduated from KTH Royal Institute of Technology with a masters degree in Interactive Media Technology. In my thesis I compared the attitudes of Ethiopian and Swedish youth to fake news on the internet. My professional experience includes working as a graphic designer and front-end developer.

            During spring 2019 I volunteered for an international project organized by Fojo media institute. I and four other volunteers from Ethiopia and Sweden genereated ideas to improve media literacy in rural Ethiopia. At the <a href='https://fojo.se/news/en/ethiopia/fojo-arrangerade-en-unik-mediereformskonferens/'>conference</a> <em>Promoting journalism and democracy in Practice, Media Reform in a time of change</em> we presented our concept of a campaign of animated movies and music that is both easy to spread and designed to appeal to a diverse target audience. In addition to participating in the ideation work, I made sure that we set clear goals, followed our schedule and evaluated our ideas. I wrote my master thesis in parallell with this project.

            For the course <em>advanced graphics and interaction</em> my group made a concept for the adverts of the future. By connecting the advertisement screen and the user's own handheld device it became possible for the user to manipulate the virtual watch as if it was sitting on their own wrist. <a href= 'https://swishswap.wordpress.com/'>Here</a> is our final deliverable.

            For the course <em>Advanced Project</em> I made this interactive meditative sketch made with p5.js. The purpose was to examine whether digital tools can support mindfulness. You can try it out yourself <a href="boxes/index.html">here</a>.

          <p>
              For my bachelor thesis, I made a filter visualization tool for iOS and Android with MobMuPlat and Pure Data. <a href= 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ble_teYNGawTI1PYxzKz2w5ReYf6e5Or/view?usp=sharing'>Here</a> is a video showcase. I wanted to see if I could use instant visual and auditory feedback to make filters (a notoriously hard topic to get into) more accessible and interesting. My study concluded that the visualization tool did indeed make the participants find filters more interesting. The source code can be found <a href= 'https://github.com/MGroth/SignalFilterVisualization'>here</a>.
